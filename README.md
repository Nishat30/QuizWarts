## 2. Design Decisions & Next.js Implementation

QuizWarts leverages several key **Next.js** features to deliver a fast, efficient, and scalable user experience.

### 📄 Static Site Generation (SSG)

**Quiz Categories and Individual Quiz Pages:**

- `src/app/page.js`: The homepage fetches category data at build time and renders the quiz category cards.
- `src/app/quiz/[id]/page.js`: This dynamic route uses `generateStaticParams` to pre-render individual quiz pages based on available quiz IDs.

✅ **Benefits**: Improves performance, SEO, and reduces server load as pages are served as static HTML.

---

### 🔁 Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

- Although not currently implemented, the architecture supports SSR for future dynamic features (e.g., authenticated dashboards).
- At present, all data is imported statically into components.

---

### 🔌 API Routes

- Not yet used since all quiz data is imported directly.
- For future features (e.g., login, external APIs), Next.js API routes will be used.

---

### 🖼️ next/image

- `next/image` is used to optimize images (lazy-load, resize, modern formats like WebP) for better performance and UX across all devices and network conditions.

---

## 3. Challenges Faced & Solutions

### 🧠 Client vs Server Component Interaction

**Challenge:**  
Handling quiz logic, state, and `localStorage` on the client while keeping static data rendering on the server.

**Solution:**  

- Marked `QuizClient.js` with `"use client"`.
- Passed `initialQuizData` from the server component (`page.js`) as props.
- Encapsulated all interactivity and state inside the client component.

## 4. AI Coding Tools Utilization

AI tools significantly accelerated development. They were used for:

### 🐞 Debugging Help

- Resolving persistent errors  
- JSX namespace build issues with Recharts  

### 📖 Learning & Explanation

- Quick grasp of SSG, SSR, and `next/image`  
- Tailwind best practices  
- Scrollbar targeting and CSS quirks
